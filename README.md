# WINFO2.0

We aim to build a platform that will improve the reading comprehension of middle school students in the greater Seattle area through gamification content. We will do this by implementing gamified reading, where the student participates in engaging activities (building characters, earning points, buying accessories, etc.) and a quiz feature to test their attention span and comprehension of the reading content.


How might we make the learning process more interactive and engaging for middle school students in the greater Seattle area in order to improve their reading comprehension?


The key components of our Software Architecture are the following:
* Reading Comprehension Quiz (Multiple choice & short-answer format)
* Character/Avatar Building Activity
* Book Reading View (with highlighting, annotating, font size/color adjustments)
* Profile Page (stores user progress and avatar details)
* Homepage/Library (to select books)
* Marketplace (where users can redeem points for accessories)
* Bookmark/Progress Bar

Our tech stack includes: HTML, CSS, Javascript, a character/avatar building React library, a React library for importing PDFs and highlighting/annotating PDFs, React.js, and Firebase. The web app will be hosted on Firebase, which we will use to monitor user authentication and logins, as well as usersâ€™ profile data, such as their progress in books that they have started to read/completed, and the character that they built in the activity.
